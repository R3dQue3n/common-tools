Common functions for Python

###########################
This git is a repo for commonly access functions in Python which are not covered effectively in existing modules.  This area is to provide a home for functions which are often used, and frequently reaccomplished in a variety of ways.  Some examples would be converting state names to abbreviations and the reverse, converting units of measure, etc.

Please adhere to these few small rules:

1) Don't duplicate functions available in common modules already available in common Python implementations

2) Don't alter existing modules unless for the purposes of enhancement or bug-fix unless agreed upon

3) Align functions into modules of similar type.  For example, unit conversion functions may all be grouped into a single module called conversions.py or the like.  

4) If you add a function, be sure to also update the master list to reflect the changes.  This will allow us to track where funcs are located and make intelligent grouping of functions where needed.

Please feel free to add / subtract / change / use as you see fit.  This is an effort to reduce overhead in coding for Python projects we are often called upon to write.  Many of you will have superior development skills and don't be shy about telling us if we screw something up or if there is a more 'Pythonic" way.  We all want to get better.

Cheers,
Red
